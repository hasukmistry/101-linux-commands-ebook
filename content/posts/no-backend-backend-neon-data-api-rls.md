We built a multi-tenant team task board with no backend. The browser loads static files, signs in with Neon Auth, and reads and writes through the Neon Data API. There is no API server, no serverless function and no middleware. Who belongs to which team is Neon Auth's job; what a signed-in user may read or write is decided in Postgres, by row-level security policies, column grants and one carefully written function.

Then we gave a second team's owner, eve, a valid account and a script, and had her try 25 ways into the first team, plus two tries from the wrong role inside it: crafted filters, embedded joins, aggregate counts, forged tokens, `alg: none`, a token signed with her own key, bulk updates, upserts over the other team's ids. **All 27 were refused.** We then broke the security layer four realistic ways, one at a time. Three of them let specific attacks through, and the suite caught each one. The fourth, a sloppy `WITH CHECK (true)`, did nothing on its own, because a second layer stopped it.

The one thing the policies could not stop was time. **A member removed from a team kept reading its data for fifteen and a half minutes**, the life of the token they already held plus about thirty seconds. That one has a fix.

```github
The-DevOps-Daily/neon-data-api-rls
```

## TLDR

- **The architecture:** static React, Neon Auth organizations for teams, the Neon Data API for every query, and Postgres (policies, grants, one function) as the authorization layer. Zero server code.
- **The tenant comes from a signed token.** Neon Auth puts the active organization in the JWT, and `auth.organization_id()` reads it inside Postgres. Every policy is `org_id = auth.organization_id()`.
- **27 attacks, 27 refused.** Each attack has to return exactly the expected answer, and every column of the victim's rows is compared before and after, so a "refusal" that quietly changed data would have failed.
- **Column grants are the second wall.** A policy with `WITH CHECK (true)` let nothing through, because the client is never granted the `org_id` column. Adding table-wide grants on top is what opened it.
- **Removal is not instant.** Right after being removed, a member's old token still read, wrote and called the RPC, and it kept reading for its full 900 seconds plus 28. Checking Neon Auth's member table inside the policies cut it off at once; reads and writes stayed within a millisecond, the RPC was 5 ms slower.
- **Fast enough not to notice.** A Data API request took 41 to 44 ms at p50; a plain TCP connect to the same address took 40 ms.

## Prerequisites

- A Neon project with Neon Auth enabled on the branch. Its organization plugin, which this uses for teams, is on by default.
- The Data API provisioned on the same branch with Neon Auth as the provider, in the Console or with `neon data-api create`.
- Node.js 20 or later for the scripts, and the repository above.
- Some familiarity with Postgres row-level security. [Your Tenant Isolation Is One Forgotten WHERE Clause Away](/posts/postgres-row-level-security-multi-tenant) covers the model this builds on.

## What "no backend" means here

In a usual stack, the browser calls your API, your API authenticates the user, works out their tenant and runs the query with a `WHERE tenant_id = ...` it wrote itself. Every one of those steps is code you own and can get wrong.

Here, three managed pieces replace it:

```diagram
{
  "type": "flow",
  "title": "One request, no server code",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "label": "Browser",
      "sub": "static files only",
      "icon": "globe",
      "tone": "slate"
    },
    {
      "label": "Neon Auth",
      "sub": "signs the team token",
      "icon": "lock",
      "tone": "violet"
    },
    {
      "label": "Data API",
      "sub": "checks the token",
      "icon": "net",
      "tone": "blue"
    },
    {
      "label": "Postgres",
      "sub": "RLS picks the rows",
      "icon": "database",
      "tone": "green"
    }
  ]
}
```

The Data API is PostgREST-compatible: `GET /tasks?select=id,title&done=eq.false` is a query, `POST /rpc/org_summary` calls a function. It checks the JWT on every request against Neon Auth's keys and runs the query as the `authenticated` role, with the token's claims available inside Postgres through the `auth` functions.

So the whole authorization story fits in two SQL files. Everything below is about whether those two files hold.

## The tenant is a signed claim

A team is a Neon Auth organization. When a user picks one, Neon Auth issues a token that names it in an `o` claim, and it only does that for an organization the user belongs to. Asking to make someone else's team active returns `403 User is not a member of the organization`, which is attack T7 below.

Inside Postgres, `auth.organization_id()` returns that claim. The tables default their tenant column to it, and every policy compares against it:

```sql
create table tasks (
  org_id     uuid not null default auth.organization_id(),
  id         uuid not null default gen_random_uuid(),
  title      text not null check (length(title) between 1 and 200),
  done       boolean not null default false,
  created_by text not null default auth.user_id(),
  created_at timestamptz not null default now(),
  primary key (org_id, id)
);

alter table tasks enable row level security;

create policy tasks_read on tasks for select
  using (org_id = auth.organization_id());

create policy tasks_insert on tasks for insert
  with check (org_id = auth.organization_id());

-- Only owners and admins delete. The role is in the same signed claim.
create policy tasks_delete on tasks for delete
  using (
    org_id = auth.organization_id()
    and auth.organization() ->> 'role' in ('owner', 'admin')
  );
```

If you read [our earlier RLS post](/posts/postgres-row-level-security-multi-tenant), this is the same shape as its `tenant_id = current_tenant()`. The difference is where the tenant comes from. There, the application server wrote it into a session setting before each query, and a bug in that server could set it wrong. Here there is no server; the tenant arrives in a token that Neon Auth signed and the Data API verified.

The primary key is `(org_id, id)` for the reason that post gives: with a globally unique id, a failed insert could tell eve that an id exists in another team. Scoped to the tenant, her copy of an id lands in her own team.

## Grants are the wall behind the wall

The Data API exposes whatever the grants allow. The policies decide which rows; the grants decide which tables, columns and functions. We made the grants as narrow as the app is:

```sql
grant select on tasks, task_comments to authenticated;
grant insert (title, done) on tasks to authenticated;
grant update (title, done) on tasks to authenticated;
grant delete on tasks to authenticated;

revoke all on tasks, task_comments from anonymous;
```

The migration revokes everything from `authenticated` on these tables first, so a table-wide grant made earlier cannot outlive the narrow ones. After that, the client can insert a title and a done flag, and nothing else. It never sends `org_id` or `created_by`: the column defaults fill them from the token. An update cannot move a task to another team, whatever a policy says, because `org_id` is not an updatable column for this role.

That turned out to matter more than it looks, as the break section shows.

There is one RPC, a dashboard summary. It is `security definer`, which means it runs with the owner's rights and no policy applies inside it. Its `WHERE` clause is the only thing keeping it to the caller's team:

```sql
create function org_summary()
returns table (total bigint, done bigint, comments bigint)
language sql stable security definer set search_path = public, pg_temp as $$
  select count(*), count(*) filter (where t.done),
    (select count(*) from task_comments c where c.org_id = auth.organization_id())
  from tasks t
  where t.org_id = auth.organization_id()
$$;

-- Functions are executable by PUBLIC by default, which includes anonymous.
revoke execute on function org_summary() from public;
grant execute on function org_summary() to authenticated;
```

## A hostile client, 27 ways

The attack script signs in three users: alice owns Acme, bob is a member of Acme, and eve owns Evil Corp. Twenty-five of the attacks are eve's, all aimed at Acme; M1 and M2 are the wrong role inside Acme. The requests are raw HTTP, not a client library, because a library tidies up exactly the requests an attacker would not.

Each attack states exactly what must come back, down to the status code; an error, a rate limit or an unexpected status counts as a failure, not a pass. Then the harness reads every column of every Acme row through the owner connection and compares it with a copy taken just before, so an attack that returned an error but still changed something fails too. It also refuses to run if Acme has nothing to steal.

```terminal
{
  "title": "attack.mjs",
  "prompt": "$",
  "autoplay": false,
  "steps": [
    {
      "cmd": "node scripts/attack.mjs --json",
      "output": "id   attack                                       status rows result\nR1   list every task                              200    2    held\nR2   filter on Acme's org_id                      200    0    held\nR3   ask for Acme's task ids directly             200    0    held\nR4   OR the filter with her own org               200    2    held\nR5   embed comments inside tasks                  200    2    held\nR6   read comments on an Acme task                200    0    held\nR7   exact count of Acme's tasks                  200    0    held\nR8   aggregate count() over all tasks             200    1    held\nR9   the org_summary RPC                          200    1    held\nR10  ask for the neon_auth schema by header       404    -    held\nW1   insert a task with Acme's org_id             403    -    held\nW2   update every task in Acme                    200    0    held\nW3   move her task into Acme                      403    -    held\nW4   delete Acme's tasks                          200    0    held\nW5   upsert over an Acme task id                  403    -    held\nW6   comment on an Acme task                      409    -    held\nW7   comment as someone else                      403    -    held\nM1   bob (member) deletes an Acme task            200    0    held\nM2   alice (owner) edits bob's comment            200    0    held\nT1   no token at all                              400    -    held\nT2   no token, call the RPC                       400    -    held\nT3   her token with the org claim edited to Acme  400    -    held\nT4   alg none, no key id                          400    -    held\nT5   alg none, with the real key id               400    -    held\nT6   signed by her own key, with the real key id  400    -    held\nT7   ask Neon Auth to make Acme her active org    403    -    held\nT8   ask Neon Auth to change her role claim       400    -    held\n\n27 of 27 held"
    }
  ]
}
```

A few of these are worth reading closely.

**R7 and R8 ask for counts, not rows.** `Prefer: count=exact` and `select=count()` are how a PostgREST client learns totals. Both counted only what the policy let eve see: zero Acme tasks, and exactly her own.

**W2 and W4 return 200 with no rows.** Row-level security does not raise an error when a statement touches rows you may not see; it leaves them out. An `UPDATE` across all of Acme succeeds and updates nothing. That is correct, and it is also why the app treats an empty result from a delete as the refusal. We come back to this in the gotchas.

**W1, W3, W5 and W7 never reached a policy.** They tried to set `org_id`, `id` or `created_by`, and the column grants refused them with `403 permission denied for table`.

**T1 to T6 never reached Postgres.** No token, an edited claim, `alg: none` with and without the real key id, and a token signed with eve's own key were all rejected at the Data API with `400`: `missing authentication credentials`, `signature error`, `missing key id` and `signature algorithm not supported`.

**T8 asked Neon Auth to change her role claim.** The Data API picks the Postgres role from the token's `role` claim, so a user who could set it would pick their own database role. Neon Auth refused the update with `400`; the stored role stayed `user` and her next token still said `authenticated`.

**R10 is weaker than it looks.** It asks for the `neon_auth` schema with an `Accept-Profile` header. The Data API ignored the header and looked in `public`, where there is no `user` table, so it answered 404. That shows the Data API only serves `public` here; it does not test the permissions on Neon Auth's own tables.

## Four ways to break it

A test suite that has only ever passed proves little. The break script applies one realistic mistake, runs all 27 attacks against it, checks that exactly the expected attacks got through, and restores:

```terminal
{
  "title": "break.mjs",
  "prompt": "$",
  "autoplay": false,
  "steps": [
    {
      "cmd": "node scripts/break.mjs",
      "output": "weak-with-check: tasks_insert says WITH CHECK (true), everything else unchanged\n  still held: all 27\n\nweak-with-check-and-default-grants: the same policy, plus the table-wide grants the Data API can add for you\n  BROKEN 1: W1 (insert a task with Acme's org_id)\n\ndefiner-without-filter: org_summary() loses its WHERE clause\n  BROKEN 1: R9 (the org_summary RPC)\n\ntable-without-rls: task_comments ships with row-level security off\n  BROKEN 2: R6 (read comments on an Acme task), M2 (alice (owner) edits bob's comment)\n\nrestored: 27 of 27 held again"
    }
  ]
}
```

**`WITH CHECK (true)` on its own let nothing through.** This is the mistake our earlier RLS post warns about, and with a server in front it would let a client write into any tenant. Here the client cannot choose `org_id` at all, so the weak policy had nothing to wave through. The column grants caught it.

**The same policy plus table-wide grants opened it.** The Data API setup offers to grant `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE` on every table in `public` to `authenticated`. That is convenient, and it is exactly what turned a harmless mistake into eve inserting tasks into Acme. If you take the default grants, your policies are the only wall, and every `WITH CHECK` has to be right.

**A `security definer` function without its filter leaked counts.** No policy applies inside it, so the `WHERE` clause is everything. This is the mistake most likely to survive review, because the function looks like a harmless dashboard query.

**A table without row-level security leaked its rows.** `task_comments` with RLS off let eve read Acme's comments by task id. New tables are where this happens, because `enable row level security` is a separate statement nobody remembers until it is missing. It also broke M2 inside Acme: the rule that only a comment's author can edit it disappeared with the policy.

## The fifteen minutes

Policies decide what a token may do. They do not decide how long a token lives.

The revocation script signs bob in, removes him from Acme through Neon Auth, and keeps using the token he already had:

```terminal
{
  "title": "revocation.mjs, token only",
  "prompt": "$",
  "autoplay": false,
  "steps": [
    {
      "comment": "about 16 minutes: it waits for the old token to die"
    },
    {
      "cmd": "node scripts/revocation.mjs",
      "output": "   2s bob's token: org Acme, expires in 900s\n   2s before removal, bob's token: tasks 3, comments 1, org_summary total 3, insert inserted\n   3s alice removes bob from Acme: HTTP 200\n   3s bob asks for a new token: HTTP 500, no token returned\n   3s right after removal, bob's OLD token: tasks 4, comments 1, org_summary total 4, insert inserted\n 932s the old token is refused (HTTP 400, 0 rows), 30s after its exp\n      the last request it served was 28s after its exp\n 933s cleaned up 2 probe task(s) the inserts above wrote\n 934s bob invited back into Acme"
    }
  ]
}
```

Right after the removal, bob's request for a new token fails with HTTP 500. The token he already holds does not notice: it still reads Acme's tasks and comments, calls the RPC, and writes a new task (the fourth task in the list is the probe it wrote a line earlier). Task reads kept working for the rest of the token's 900-second life and 28 seconds past its `exp` by our client's clock; the next check, two seconds later, was refused. The extra seconds look like leeway for clock skew, but we did not measure the verifier's setting. We checked writes and the RPC right after the removal, not to the end. If "removed from the team" has to mean "cannot touch the team's data", fifteen and a half minutes is a long time.

The fix is to ask a second question in every policy: is this user still a member right now? Neon Auth keeps memberships in `neon_auth.member`, which the `authenticated` role cannot read, so a `security definer` function looks it up:

```sql
create function current_org_role() returns text
language sql stable security definer set search_path = pg_catalog, pg_temp as $$
  select m.role from neon_auth.member m
  where m."organizationId" = auth.organization_id()
    and m."userId" = auth.user_id()::uuid
$$;

alter policy tasks_read on tasks
  using (org_id = auth.organization_id() and (select current_org_role()) is not null);
```

Wrapping the call in `(select ...)` lets Postgres evaluate it once per statement instead of once per row; a statement that involves two policies still does two lookups. The delete policy reads the role from the table as well. The RPC needs the same condition in its `WHERE` clause, because policies do not apply inside it.

With it on, the same test, every path refused the moment bob was removed:

```terminal
{
  "title": "revocation.mjs, strict",
  "prompt": "$",
  "autoplay": false,
  "steps": [
    {
      "cmd": "node scripts/strict.mjs",
      "output": "strict mode on: policies also check Neon Auth's member table"
    },
    {
      "cmd": "node scripts/revocation.mjs",
      "output": "   1s bob's token: org Acme, expires in 900s\n   1s before removal, bob's token: tasks 3, comments 1, org_summary total 3, insert inserted\n   1s alice removes bob from Acme: HTTP 200\n   1s bob asks for a new token: HTTP 500, no token returned\n   1s right after removal, bob's OLD token: tasks 0, comments 0, org_summary total 0, insert HTTP 403 new row violates row-level security policy for table \"tasks\"\n   2s the old token got nothing after the removal (HTTP 200, 0 rows), 899s before its exp\n   2s cleaned up 1 probe task(s) the inserts above wrote\n   2s bob invited back into Acme"
    }
  ]
}
```

All 27 attacks still hold with it on.

Reads and writes stayed within a millisecond of the token-only run (the table under [What it costs](#h2-what-it-costs) has both runs). The RPC, which does two lookups, was 5 ms slower at p50. The two runs were about sixteen minutes apart, so some of that may be the network; we would not quote it as more than a few milliseconds. We would turn it on for anything where removal matters, which is most things. It lives in the repository as `db/optional/live_membership.sql`, applied with `npm run strict`.

## What it costs

**Per request, about one network round trip.** 100 requests of each kind, one at a time and interleaved so they shared the same network conditions, from a client about 40 ms from the Data API. The plain p50 and p95 columns are token only; the strict columns are the same requests with strict mode on, in a run about sixteen minutes later:

| Request, in ms                   | p50  | p50 strict | p95  | p95 strict |
| -------------------------------- | ---- | ---------- | ---- | ---------- |
| TCP connect (one round trip)     | 39.7 | 38.1       | 42.8 | 42.9       |
| `GET /tasks` with comment counts | 41.4 | 41.8       | 46.0 | 46.1       |
| `POST /rpc/org_summary`          | 41.3 | 46.4       | 43.2 | 50.6       |
| `PATCH` one task                 | 44.1 | 45.0       | 47.2 | 48.4       |

A read with embedded counts and an RPC took a millisecond or two more than a bare TCP connect to the same address; a write took about four. We did not isolate how much of that is JWT verification, the policies or the query, and the tables are tiny: a policy that has to join or scan grows with the data, and this does not measure that.

**On the page, one JavaScript file.** The production build is three files: 587 kB of JavaScript (161 kB gzipped), 11 kB of CSS and the HTML. It includes React, the Neon Auth client with its organization plugin, and the PostgREST client; we did not break down which part weighs what.

**In operations, nothing to run.** There is no server to deploy, patch or scale. The trade is that your security review moves into SQL, and SQL is where the four breaks above live.

## Gotchas we hit

- **A `security invoker` function with a normal body cannot see the token.** The `auth` schema belongs to `cloud_admin`, and `authenticated` has no `USAGE` on it. Your owner role cannot grant it: ours tried and got `WARNING: no privileges were granted for "auth"`. So an invoker function whose body is a string (`as $$ select auth.user_id() $$`) fails with `permission denied for schema auth`, because Postgres resolves that name when the function runs, as the caller. The same function with a SQL-standard body (`return auth.user_id()`) works, because Postgres resolves it once, when the function is created. Policies work for the same reason, and `security definer` functions work because they run as the owner. `scripts/invoker-bodies.mjs` shows all three.
- **After a removal, asking for a new token fails with HTTP 500.** Bob's `/token` call right after alice removed him returned `500` and no token, in each of our runs. It gives him nothing, so it is safe, but an app should treat it as "no longer in this team" rather than an outage.
- **New functions need a schema refresh.** The Data API caches the schema. After adding a function, some requests returned `404` until we ran `neon data-api refresh-schema`.
- **An empty result is the refusal.** A delete that RLS blocks returns `200` and zero rows, not an error. The app checks the returned rows and tells the user.
- **Switching teams means a new token.** The client caches the token until shortly before it expires, and the cached one names the old team. Our app reloads after switching.
- **Scripts must look like a browser to Neon Auth.** Sign-in from Node fails with `Origin header is required` until you send one, and Neon Auth rate-limits sign-ins, so the test harness reuses sessions.

## What we could not conclude

- **Performance at scale.** Five tasks and one comment say nothing about how a policy with a subquery behaves over millions of rows. The latency numbers are about the request path, not the data.
- **Whether fifteen minutes is fixed.** We measured the token lifetime we were given. We did not look for a way to shorten it, and a shorter one would narrow the gap without closing it.
- **Demotion.** Strict mode reads the role from Neon Auth's table, so a demoted owner should lose delete at once. We did not test it.
- **Anything about the anonymous role.** Requests without a token were rejected before they reached Postgres; we never exercised the `anonymous` role itself.
- **The limits of Neon itself.** This tests an application's security layer through the Data API. It is not a penetration test of Neon Auth or the Data API.
- **Browser behaviour beyond Chromium.** The session cookie is a partitioned third-party cookie. We drove the app in headless Chromium only, and did not test Firefox or Safari.

## What we would do

1. **Take the tenant from the token and default the column to it.** `default auth.organization_id()` means the client never names a tenant, so it cannot name the wrong one.
2. **Grant columns, not tables.** It is what turned our weakest policy into a non-event. Skip the table-wide default grants unless you are sure every `WITH CHECK` is right.
3. **Treat every `security definer` function as a policy of its own.** Put the tenant filter in it, revoke it from `public`, and test it with a hostile token.
4. **Check live membership in the policies.** A lookup in Neon Auth's member table, once per statement, closes a fifteen-minute gap.
5. **Keep a hostile client in the repository.** Twenty-seven requests take seconds to run. The break script checks that each mistake opens exactly the attacks it should, which proves the suite catches real mistakes.

The schema, the attacks, the breaks and every recorded run are in the repository.
